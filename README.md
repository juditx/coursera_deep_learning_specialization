# Coursera Deep Learning Specialization

I have been watching the videos and delivering the Jupyter Notebooks from the [Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning#about) led by Andrew Ng.

I will be uploading those notebooks that use tensorflow as I found them to be the most useful ones.

Work In Progress.
